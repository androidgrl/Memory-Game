# Memory Game Project

## How To Play

This javascript game is a project for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree program.
To play, cd into the project repo and run open index.html in the command line.

The rules of the game are simple.  Flip over a card and find it's match.
Repeat until all the cards are matched.

When the game is over you will be asked if you would like to play again and the
cards will be shuffled, the timer reset, the star rating reset, and the number
of moves reset.
